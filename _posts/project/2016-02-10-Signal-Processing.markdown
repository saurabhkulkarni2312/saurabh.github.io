### Fetal Heart Rate Extraction from Abdominal Signals.
**Aim**: To build a low cost portable device to detect fetal heart rate using an array of ECG electrodes and 
ADS128

- **Data Acquisition:** Developed a Python based algorithm for data extraction and real time noise cancellation for abdominal ECG data
- **Data Cleaning:** Implemented filtering techniques in MATLAB to remove maternal ECG and motion artifacts from the raw data
- **Detection:** Developed the MATLAB based algorithms for detecting fetal RR peaks from abdominal signals.

### MATLAB based Voice Command Recognition System 
- **Linear Prediction:** Implemented Linear Predictive Coding in MATLAB. Implemented a MATLAB based detector 
to detect formant peaks in given speech phrases.
- **Command recognition:** Used LMS Filtering, MFCC-DTW coecients to detect and execute
5 voice commands from recorded speech signal
